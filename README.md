## üîÑ Development Process

This project was built using the following workflow:

1. **Design Reference**: Components were based on the free [GitHub UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1235155662725718346) from Figma.

2. **Initial Component Generation**: Used [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) to generate the initial component code based on the design.

3. **Code Refinement**: Used [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) to clean up and refactor the generated code into modular components.

4. **Deployment**: Deployed the application on Vercel for easy access and sharing.
